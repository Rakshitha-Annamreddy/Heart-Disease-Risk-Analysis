# Heart Disease Risk Analysis

Analyzed 57,000 records to identify heart disease risk factors as part of a group project for ADTA 5240 - Final Project at the University of North Texas (Fall 2024). As the **Reporting Analyst**, I focused on interpreting results and crafting actionable recommendations.

## 🎯 Objective
Explored key risk factors (e.g., BMI, smoking, diabetes, age) for heart disease using advanced analytics, delivering data-driven insights for preventive healthcare strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- **Cloud**: Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery, Buckets)
- **Visualization**: Looker Studio, Matplotlib
- **Querying**: Advanced SQL (e.g., `APPROX_QUANTILES`)
- **Data Wrangling**: Median imputation, standardization, feature engineering
- **Dataset**: 57K rows, 28 columns (merged Kaggle and Framingham data)

## 📊 Key Findings
1. **Age & BMI**: Older adults (51-62) with obesity/overweight have the highest risk scores.
2. **Smoking & Diabetes**: Smokers with diabetes face a 55.6% heart disease prevalence.
3. **Gender**: Females show a 65% risk vs. 35% for males.
4. **Obesity**: High risk persists in obese individuals despite normal cholesterol/hypertension.

## 💡 Recommendations
- Launch targeted campaigns for obese older adults and diabetic smokers.
- Promote gender-specific screenings, especially for females.
- Raise awareness about obesity’s hidden risks via ads and health programs.

## 🔍 My Role: Reporting Analyst
- Analyzed query outputs (e.g., risk scores by age/BMI, prevalence by smoking/diabetes).
- Translated findings into clear, actionable insights for stakeholders.
- Collaborated on SQL query design and result interpretation.

## 📈 Visualizations
- Stacked charts: Risk scores by age and diabetes.
- Bar plots: Heart disease rates by BMI and gender.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `preprocessing.py`: Python script for data cleaning and feature engineering.
- `bigquery.sql`: Sample SQL queries (e.g., risk score distribution).
